## Custom Hermit

Hermit has a configurable command-line entry point which can be useful if you need to use
a custom HTTP client in order to access your private packages or manifest
sources. See the
[hermit main package](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit/blob/master/cmd/hermit/main.go) for an
example of how this is used.

This can be used to specify a custom set of sources, and other configuration, for your org.

## Installer script

A custom `install.sh` can be generated by `cmd/geninstaller`:

```text
geninstaller --dest=install.sh --dist-url=https://mycompany.com/hermit-install.sh
```
